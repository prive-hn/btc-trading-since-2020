# BTC-Trading-Since-2020

>[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

In the AI era, high-quality context becomes the most scarce asset.
This repository is an open-intelligence experiment: a public, inspectable, and continuously extensible mirror of a real trading account. It spans nearly six years, 43k+ orders, and 173k+ execution rows.
The internet likely has no comparable public repository that continuously exposes the full multi-year secondary-market history of a predominantly BTC-trading account at this level of detail.

## Why this exists

Most public trading content is narrative without ledger truth.

This repository does the opposite: it publishes a long-horizon, continuously updated historical mirror of one real trading account so other people can inspect the actual execution ledger, wallet ledger, terminal snapshots, and reconstruction anchors instead of relying on screenshots, selective anecdotes, or marketing summaries.

Open intelligence instead of selective narrative.

## Live current-state companion

For a real-time dashboard companion to this archive, see: **https://wsnb.online**
This repository is the long-horizon historical layer; `wsnb.online` is the live current-state layer.

## How to read the files

- `tradeHistory` is the main balance-affecting execution ledger.
- `order` explains order intent, status transitions, and lifecycle state.
- `walletHistory` is the wallet-side ledger for deposits, withdrawals, funding, realised PnL, spot trades, conversions, and related events.
- `position` / `wallet` / `margin` snapshots are terminal anchors for reconstructing state at the export time.
- `instrument` and `wallet-assets` are reference dictionaries so downstream users can interpret symbols, scales, settlement currencies, and contract metadata using BitMEX-native semantics.
- `walletSummary` is kept as a cross-check layer, not as the primary historical ledger.

## Privacy policy for the public version

- `account` is removed from every published file where it existed.
- `api-v1-user-walletHistory.csv`: `tx` is removed, `text` is removed, and `address` is redacted only when `transactType` is `Withdrawal` or `Transfer`.
- `api-v1-order.csv`: `text` is removed.
- `api-v1-execution-tradeHistory.csv`: `text` is intentionally kept because it helps explain fills, funding, and settlements.
- `/api/v1/user` profile data and `/api/v1/execution` raw lifecycle noise are not published.

## Derived performance methodology

`derived-equity-curve.csv` is intentionally simple and auditable:

1. It tracks **wallet-equivalent wealth across XBT and USDt balances**.
2. The baseline is the first fully-funded XBT wallet balance after the final completed deposit on the first trading day.
3. After that baseline, **completed withdrawals are added back**, **completed deposits are subtracted**, and internal `Transfer` rows are neutralized.
4. `Conversion` and XBT/USDt `SpotTrade` pairs are treated as **internal wallet swaps**, not losses.
5. USDt balances are converted back into XBT using the latest observed internal XBT/USDT conversion or spot rate in the published wallet ledger.
6. The resulting series is a public-friendly XBT-equivalent wealth curve. It is **not** a full historical mark-to-market NAV across every non-XBT wallet or every asset BitMEX ever credited.

This keeps the methodology auditable from the published files themselves while avoiding false cliffs when the account temporarily rotates between XBT and USDt.

## What is intentionally not in this repo

- Raw API secrets
- `/api/v1/user` profile payloads
- `/api/v1/execution` rows that are only lifecycle noise beyond `tradeHistory`
- login/IP/device/profile data
- chain tx hashes from wallet history

## Update policy

This repository is designed for recurring refreshes.

Each update should:

1. pull the full raw dataset from BitMEX,
2. rebuild the public root with the same filenames and privacy rules,
3. commit the new root,
4. tag the commit as `data-YYYY-MM-DD`.

That gives stable filenames for readers and full daily traceability through Git history.
